## THIS IS NOT A PRODUCT

This piece of experimental code was left public for others to discover and experiment with. It's not a finished product (and never will be), no support will be provided for this code. It might work, it might not work.

This project is a representative of my personal experiments, so expect:
- low code quality standards
- bugs and vulnerabilities

DO NOT expect:
- this project to work
